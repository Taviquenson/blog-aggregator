The psql connection string template:
protocol://username:password@host:port/database

The psql connection string:
"postgres://tavo:@localhost:5432/gator"
Which can be tested/used as such:
psql "postgres://tavo:@localhost:5432/gator"

To run the postgres Up migration using cli tool goose, go into directory sql/schema and do:
goose postgres "postgres://tavo:@localhost:5432/gator" up
(based on this template: goose postgres <connection_string> up)

You can check if the Up migration worked by running:
psql <database_name>
\dt

Add the connection string to the .gatorconfig.json
However, here in the config file it needs an additional sslmode=disable query string:
protocol://username:password@host:port/database?sslmode=disable
Your application code needs to know to not try to use SSL locally.
